\section{Introduction}
Particle systems are widely used in simulations, games, movies, etc. They can be used to simulate and visualize smoke, water, fire, chemical reactions, clouds, even entire galaxies and star systems. Particle systems have for example been used in fluid dynamics to model turbulent flows \cite{course_book}.

In this project a simple version of a particle system has been implemented in order to simulate and visualize four different effects, namely fire, an explosion, a fountain, and a simple tornado. Screenshots of these four can be seen in figure \ref{fig:simulations}.
